2/2

The tingbowie kit I'm working with comes with 8 different resistors. So today, I mainly worked on figuring out the color codes and soldering my first few pieces.

I soldered the LED lights. Doing the resistors maintaining the same difference in height from the board is really hard even though it seemed really easy. However, it's getting better. I had to redo a couple solder joints to fix my distances and to avoid any short circuits.

Added the switches and the power socket. Todays joints are more volcano shaped- how I'd want them to be, so pretty happy about that. I added the four corner stands as well. In a good place to call its complete.
